# courier-service
The project explores on the working and simulation of a Courier service system.
The Project has both the User and Admin interfaces.
User Interface: A user can book a new delivery and can able to track the order, 
user is given the mode of delivery namely General, speed post and Express delivery 
increasing to its priority
Admin Interface: It consists of showing the orders to be delivered based on the 
priority of the mode. The highest priority one’s are delivered first. It shows the
shortest path between the source and destination of a selected delivery.
Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm is used to compute the minimum distance between 
the source and destination of the delivery This project shows simulation of courier 
system in both the user and admin point of view.
